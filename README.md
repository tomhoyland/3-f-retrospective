**What is it?**

A simple and easy-to-facilitate retrospective that supports teams in identifying what is accelerating or slowing down progress towards their goal through the lens of Flow, Focus, and Feedback. This retrospective also includes an experiment-based movement-to-action section.



**Who is it for?**

- It is helpful for Product and Service Teams but works particularly well with Platform and Enabler Teams.

- Facilitators, Coaches, Scrum Masters, Delivery Managers, Software Engineers, Business Analysts, Project Managers etc.



**How to use it**


1. Define, align on, or confirm your Product or Team Goal with participants.
2. Identify, share, and understand what is accelerating the team and individuals towards the goal or slowing the team down and detracting from achieving that goal through the categories of Flow, Focus, and Feedback on the "What's Happening" canvas.
3. Prioritise one or more impediments, challenges, or changes to explore, adding them to the "Evolve and Improve with Experiments" canvas.
4. For each impediment, challenge, or change, attempt to answer the prompts to define an experiment or something to try to evolve or improve your system of work.
5. Implement your experiments, learn, and see if they made a positive difference towards your Product or Team Goal.
